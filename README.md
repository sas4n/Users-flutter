# Users-flutter

An infinite scrollable page

A Flutter project used clean code architecture for getting users' data from a REST api and showing them in a infinite scrollable page .

## Run the project

```bash
cd users_flutter
```

To avoid getting CORS error and since this app will only be running on dev environment, we can disable web security flag.

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-browser-flag "--disable-web-security"
```
